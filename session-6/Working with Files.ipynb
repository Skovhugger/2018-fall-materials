You could open and close the file by calling `open()` and `close()`, but if a bug in your program prevents the `close()` statement from being executed, the file may never close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call `close()` too early in your program, you’ll find yourself trying to work with a closed file (a file you can’t access), which leads to more errors. It is not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the time is right.\n",

You can open a file in *read mode* (`'r'`), *write mode* (`'w'`), *append mode* (`'a'`), or a mode that allows you to *read and write* to the file (`'r+'`).

    "The `writerow()` method for Writer objects takes a list argument. Each value in the list is placed in its own cell in the output CSV file. The return value of `writerow()` is the number of characters written to the file for that row (including newline characters). Notice how the Writer object automatically escapes the comma in the value `'614,5'` with double quotes in the CSV file. The `csv` module saves you from having to handle these special cases yourself."
