# Session 1: Your first program

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks and code for the first session of the
seminar: "Introduction to Programming" at IT University Copenhagen.

To view these slides, either open them on GitHub at 
[itu-qsp/2018-fall-materials](https://github.com/itu-qsp/2018-fall-materials). 
On GitHub however, you cannot interact with the material. To do that you can use 
MyBinder by clicking on this button: 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/itu-qsp/2018-fall-materials/master). 
Wait until you see the list of files in the notebook (it can take a while to
start up), and access the session you need.
**Note** that your code will **not** be saved automatically. You will have to
download the files you change to your own computer, if you would like to look 
at them later.

## Hand ins
Hand ins are available in the `homework/` folder. Please follow the description
