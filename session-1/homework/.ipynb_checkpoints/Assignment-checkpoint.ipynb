    "# Session 1 Assignment Hand-in\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand in 3 things in a single .zip file:\n",
    "1. one .py that you make yourself with all your code. You make this in Mu. Add a `#` to the beginning of any lines that make your program crash (only lines you can't fix). Also add `#` to the start of lines where you answer questions in text rather than code. \n",
    "2. the eliza.py file\n",
    "3. the eliza_language.py file\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a .zip file select the three files (or the directory that you have them in) and choose \"Compress\" / \"Komprim√©r\" in the context menu. On Windows right-click the selection to get the context menu. On Mac either click with two fingers on the touchpad or hold down the ctlr-key while clicking.  \n",
    "Upload the .zip file on LearnIT under `Assignment 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise A, Analysis assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will investigate how a specific function works and try out its options. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try to write `print(` in Mu and read the docstring (the information that pops up). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the print function you wrap it around what you want to print. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print('Hello world')` <- Write and run this code in Mu. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, you can have your data (`'Hello world'` in this case) inside a variable and feed that to the print function.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "data_variable = 'Hello world'\n",
    "print(data_variable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you print something using print(), like a variable or string, it is automatically followed by a newline-command. \n",
    "To test this in Mu create the following five different variables and then print them, one at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A variable named `first` which consists of a string. The string is the word `\"Hello\"`.\n",
    "(print it!)\n",
    "2. A variable called `second` that contains the string `\",\"`\n",
    "(print it!)\n",
    "3. A variable called `third` that contains the text `you can` as a string.\n",
    "(print it!)\n",
    "4. The string-variable `fourth` that should contain `code!`\n",
    "(print it!)\n",
    "5. A variable called `last`. This should be of the type integer, and contain your favourit number. Print `last`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, print() is something called a function in Python (can you recognize the datatype of 'Hello world'?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pssst: If you do not know the type of something, you can always check it by calling it with the function `type()`.  \n",
    "(Check out the docstring for type, by writing `type(` in Mu. Then test it out for `Hello world` to check if you were right\n",
    "on the data type. You need to print it to make it show.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Now print all variables again. This time it should require a lot less code, since the variables already is stored in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What does '\\n' mean in Python? Remember; docstrings are your best friend, google is your second best friend!\n",
    "2. Now change the way print(), prints. Instead of ending with a new line, it now should end with a questionmark (`?`). Check the docstring again if this is confusing.\n",
    "3. Print your first four variables again, this time they should all print on the same line, separated by question marks instead of new lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there is an even better way to print multiple variables. Try to print the first four variables, using just **one**\n",
    "call with the print()-function. So the variables from `first` to `fourth` go inside the parenthesis with commas in-between. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you print multiple variables, they are by default separated by an empty space (in Python this is equivalent to `' '`).\n",
    "Take a peek at the docstring for `print()` again:\n",
    "Can you figure out how to make all the variables be separated by a comma instead, or a word?\n",
    "Print the variables again, this time separated by a comma. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use all your new-found coding skills, variables and print-knowledge to get precisely this printed:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hello,`  \n",
    "`you can code!`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus exercise (OPTIONAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this craziness:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print()`  \n",
    "`print(third.title()[0:3], 'r ', 'favourit number is', '+'.join([1]*last), fourth[-1], sep='')`\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is printed, and why does it do that? Can you explain what the comma-separated parts are doing (`third.title()[0:3]`, `r `, ...)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise B, Explicit assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will modify existing code to better suit your needs and wishes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Copy and paste your ELIZA program, which you typed in earlier in class, into your .py file for hand-in. If you did not attend the session at ITU find a solution in the lecture notes `My First Program.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify your ELIZA program, so that it starts the conversation with a different question than `Hello. How are you feeling today?`.\n",
    "    - Find the string `Hello. How are you feeling today?` in the code (Hints: a string is enclosed by '' or \"\", this string is inside a print function)\n",
    "    - Delete the old message and write your own message (Hint: keep the '' or \"\")\n",
    "2. Modify your ELIZA program to exit when the user types: Stop it! I have had enough!\n",
    "    - Add a conditional using the keyword `if` (Hint: try putting it on different lines inside the `while` loop)\n",
    "    - Between the `if` and the colon at the end of the line compare the variable `statement` with the string `Stop it! I have had enough!`\n",
    "    - Use keyword `break` on the line after the `if` line to exit the `while` loop (Hint: remember always indentation on the line after a colon)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try to figure out where your ELIZA program gets the sentences from, which it prints when interacting with you. Name the file and copy and paste some of those lines as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise C, Implicit assignment:  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will try to translate a human problem into a computer problem (and optionally turn it into code). You may choose to hand-in pseudo-code or working code but add a `#` to the beginning of each line if writing pseudo-code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use your new skills to make a super-boring game. The computer asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10 and if it is the right number the user is congratulated. If it is not then the user is asked to guess again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra hard: Only give the user a limited number of guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra extra hard: Make the game slightly less boring by changing the number every time the game starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra extra extra hard: Give the user a hint when they guess wrong.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Exercise D, what is a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Watch the video under: https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndTheMindOfManP3TheUniversalMachine\n",
    "    - Describe what a computer is and what is its purpose.\n",
    "    - What is a program?\n",
    "    - What is the role of humans in relation to computers?\n",
    "    - What is a programming language?\n",
