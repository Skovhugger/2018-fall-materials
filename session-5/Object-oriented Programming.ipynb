The `__init__()` method creates an instance representing this particular book and sets the `author` and `title` attributes using the values we provided. The `__init__()` method has no explicit return statement, but Python automatically returns an instance representing this book. We store that instance in the variable `empty_book`. The *naming convention* is helpful here: we can usually assume that a capitalized name like `Book` refers to a class, and a lowercase name like `empty_book` refers to a single instance created from a class.\n",
